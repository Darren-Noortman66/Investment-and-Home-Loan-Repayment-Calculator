* **What is this repo or project?**

    This project is used to work with two different calculators (investment and home-loan-repayment).
* **How does it work?**

    This project works with python only and is executed using the 'finance_calculators.py' file. Simply follow the instructions/ options presented to work with the program.
* **Who will use this repo or project?**

    This project was made for a fake financial company as a project for my course with Hyperion Development. (Hyperion-Dev Project)
* **What is the goal of this project?**
    
    This project is meant to allow the user to work with two created calculators: Investment Calculator and Home-Loan-Repayment Calculator. (According to which the user wishes to work with.) The user will be asked to insert the needed values and the program will calulate the inserted values.


## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.

Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .py, such as PyCharm. (If you don't have one installed.)
Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'finance_calculators.py' file. This is the execution file for the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Now that you have the program running, you will have options/ instructions printed on the screen for you. Choose amongst these options to work with the program as you wish.

To test your input/ code, you can look at the output printed to see if the information presented is correct.


## How you can help

No help is needed right now, as these are currently being marked to Hyperion-Development's standards. However, if you do see improvements that can be made, then please feel free to point them out :D
